The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with early works dating as far back as 1897. The name \"knapsack problem\" dates back to the early works of the mathematician Tobias Dantzig (1884–1956),and refers to the commonplace problem of packing the most valuable or useful items without overloading the luggage.\n",

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision-makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.\n",

It cannot carry a weight of more than 35 kilograms.\n",

But it is very important to do optimization because a classifier may produce a bad classification accuracy not because, for example, the data is noisy or the used learning algorithm is weak but due to the bad selection of the learning parameters initial values. As a result, there are different optimization techniques suggested by operation research (OR) researchers to do such work of optimization.

The result of the fitness function is the fitness value representing the quality of the solution. The higher the fitness value the higher the quality the solution. Selection of the best individuals based on their quality is applied to generate what is called a mating pool where the higher quality individual has higher probability of being selected in the mating pool.\n",

        "* The individuals in the mating pool are called parents. Every two parents selected from the mating pool will generate two offspring (children). By just mating high-quality individuals, it is expected to get a better quality offspring than its parents. This will kill the bad individuals from generating more bad individuals. By keeping selecting and mating high-quality individuals, there will be higher chances to just keep good properties of the individuals and leave out bad ones. Finally, this will end up with the desired optimal or acceptable solution. (As known as elitism: A practical variant of the general process of constructing a new population is to allow the best organism(s) from the current generation to carry over to the next, unaltered. This strategy is known as elitist selection and guarantees that the solution quality obtained by the GA will not decrease from one generation to the next. But here in the real world, things don't work that way. )\n",

        "* But the offspring currently generated using the selected parents just have the characteristics of its parents and no more without changes. There is no new added to it and thus the same drawbacks in its parents will actually exist in the new offspring. To overcome such problem, some changes will be applied to each offspring to create new individuals. The set of all newly generated individuals will be the new population that replaces the previously used old population. Each population created is called a generation. The process of replacing the old population by the new one is called replacement. The following diagram summarizes the steps of GA.\n",

For parent-2, gene value is 0 and the corresponding alpha value is also 0 hence, 0x0=0.

Because mutation is the ultimate source of the genetic variation required for adaptation, it can be appealing to suppose that the genomic mutation rate is adjusted to a level that best promotes adaptation. Most mutations with phenotypic effects are harmful, however, and thus there is relentless selection within populations for lower genomic mutation rates. Selection on beneficial mutations can counter this effect by favoring alleles that raise the mutation rate, but the effect of beneficial mutations on the genomic mutation rate is extremely sensitive to recombination and is unlikely to be important in sexual populations. In contrast, high genomic mutation rates can evolve in asexual populations under the influence of beneficial mutations, but this phenomenon is probably of limited adaptive significance and represents, at best, a temporary reprieve from the continual selection pressure to reduce mutation. The physiological cost of reducing mutation below the low level observed in most populations may be the most important factor in setting the genomic mutation rate in sexual and asexual systems, regardless of the benefits of mutation in producing new adaptive variation. Maintenance of mutation rates higher than the minimum set by this \"cost of fidelity\" is likely only under special circumstances.

Since the population size remains the same as the first iteration(npop), the number of individuals at the bottom of the sorted population equal to the number of new offsprings produced in the previous iteration are eliminated from the selection process to breed new offsprings, and the process continues — this is how the process of elimination takes place.\n",

Because it has a really good explanation. However, the codes given in the article do not work properly and are confusing, but they have also developed a solution for it. There is a properly working version of all the code in Colab. However, I think that the return part of the \"bounds\" function in this code may be missing, I added this and I think the code works with higher performance. I also added a simple \"verbose\" function for return results.\n",
